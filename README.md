# smt

**smt** - is mine first "large" PHP-project. This project was my graduation work at *Saratov State Technical University's Vocational Pedagogical College*, and I've got the maximum grade for it. That was hilarious.
Topic of my diploma was "An online electronics and hardware web-store development". At that moment I was interested in PHP and decided to write web-application with pure PHP 5.6, HTML 5, CSS 3, JS with Ajax and jQuery.
This project is just one big smelling messy piece of code. But everyone starts with something, right?
Maybe later I'll figure out how to start this project, because right now I have no idea how to do it. When I was developing it I didn't have any idea of such a term as "project deployment".

>Approximate time spent for development: **1 month**
>
>Approximate start and end development dates: **from 15.05.2019 to 20.06.2019**
